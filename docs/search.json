    "text": "I am a research scientist specializing in method development and research software engineering. I divide my time between two roles: at Climate Resource I work on method development, climate science research, and research software engineering. Additionally, I am affiliated with the Chair of Computational Statistics at TU Dortmund, led by Paul-Christian Bürkner, where I am focusing on the development of computational methods.\nMy current academic project focuses on developing and implementing a framework to translate expert knowledge into prior distributions for parameters in Bayesian models (cf. prior elicitation, see Publications & Talks and project website). This work combines concepts from statistics and machine learning. At Climate Resource, I primarily work as a research software engineer, developing data pipelines for various projects. In one of my main current projects, we create data pipelines and methods to integrate greenhouse gas data from multiple sources, both ground-based and satellite-derived, into a composite dataset suitable for use by climate models.\nI am particularly interested in the intersection of users, methodology, and implementation. Developing effective methods requires a broad, interdisciplinary understanding, from identifying user needs to statistical and mathematical modeling, to computational implementation. I value the interdisciplinary nature of my work, as it continually challenges my understanding, broadens my perspective, and allows me to keep learning.\nBeyond method development, I am particularly interested in knowledge transfer. Having experienced firsthand the challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration, often stemming from differences in language, mindset, and methodology, I deeply value fostering curiosity, collaboration, and mutual understanding across fields.\nWhen I’m not working, I enjoy running, cycling, and hiking in nature."

    "text": "During my bachelor’s studies in Business Psychology, I primarily focused on the user perspective, applying methods from market research and consumer psychology to address specific content-related questions. I deepened this perspective through internships and research assistant positions at market research institutes such as Ipsos GmbH and Produkt+Markt GmbH.\nAt the same time, I realized that I lacked knowledge in programming and modeling. Skills which are essential for developing flexible models that could effectively address both substantive research questions and the specific characteristics of data. This realization motivated me to pursue a master’s degree in Cognitive Science, with a focus on artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology. During this program, I gained experience in formal modeling, Bayesian methods and their implementation in R and Python, whereby I was particularly impressed by the flexibility and expressiveness of the Bayesian framework.\nDriven by a desire to deepen my expertise in formal modeling, Bayesian statistics, method development, and the computational implementation of statistical methods, I remained in academia. I worked first as a research scientist in Psychological Methods at Philipps-University Marburg, and later in Computational Statistics at TU Dortmund University.\nAfter several years in academia, my interests evolved toward applying my skills in areas with direct societal impact. This led me to my current role as a research scientist at Climate Resource, where I work at the intersection of climate science research, methodological development, and research software engineering. In my current projects I focus among others on the development of new methodologies that integrate satellite-derived information in the production of greenhouse gas forcing for Earth System Models.\nInformation about my current contributions can be found on Publications & Talks page as well as on my project website.\n Download my CV."
