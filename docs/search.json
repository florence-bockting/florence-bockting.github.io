    "text": "I am currently a doctoral student specializing in method development at the Chair of Computational Statistics at TU Dortmund, under the guidance of Paul-Christian B√ºrkner.\nMy dissertation focuses on developing and implementing a method to translate expert knowledge into corresponding prior distributions for parameters in Bayesian models (see Publications & Talks and project website). In pursuit of this objective, I am exploring the integration of methods from both statistics and machine learning.\nIn the realm of method development, I am particularly fascinated by the intersection of users, methodology, and implementation. Developing effective methods demands a broad understanding across various disciplines, from identifying user needs to statistical-mathematical modeling and computational implementation. I appreciate how this work allows me to draw upon my interdisciplinary experience and continually develop myself.\nBesides pure method development, knowledge transfer and supporting users in their analysis are important to me. From personal experience, I understand that a lot of uncertainty can arise in communication between disciplines, often due to differences in language, mindset, and methodology. I have come to know and appreciate both the user and method perspectives and wish for more knowledge exchange, curiosity, and collaboration across disciplines.\nOutside of work, you‚Äôll mostly find me running, cycling, or hiking in nature."

    "text": "During my bachelor‚Äôs studies in business psychology, I primarily focused on the user perspective, utilizing methods from market research and consumer psychology to address specific content-related questions. I deepened this perspective through internships and research assistant positions at market research institutes such as Ipsos GmbH and Produkt+Markt GmbH.\nSimultaneously, I realized that I lacked knowledge in modeling to develop models that are flexible enough to address both content-related questions and the particularity of data adequately. This realization led me to pursue a master‚Äôs degree in cognitive science, with specializations in artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology. During this time, I gained insights into formal modeling methods and their implementation in R and Python. In particular, I was greatly impressed by the flexibility offered by the Bayesian framework.\nThe desire to further deepen my knowledge in formal modeling, Bayesian statistics, and especially the computational implementation of methods led me to my current doctoral position in computational statistics at TU Dortmund. Information about my current contributions can be found on Publications & Talks page as well as on my project website.\nMy overarching goal is to integrate the valuable insights from application, methodology, and computational statistics to develop methods that encompass all perspectives.\n Download my CV."
