    "text": "I am a research associate specialized in method development at the Chair of Computational Statistics at TU Dortmund, led by Paul-Christian BÃ¼rkner.\nMy current project focuses on developing and implementing a framework to translate expert knowledge into corresponding prior distributions for parameters in Bayesian models (see Publications & Talks and project website). This work integrates approaches from both statistics and machine learning.\nI am particularly interested in the intersection of users, methodology, and implementation. Developing effective methods requires a broad understanding across multiple disciplines, encompassing everything from identifying user needs to statistical-mathematical modeling and computational implementation. I value how this work enables me to apply my interdisciplinary experience and continue to enhance my skills.\nBeyond method development, I am deeply committed to knowledge transfer and supporting users in their analyses. Having experienced firsthand the challenges that arise from interdisciplinary communicationâ€”often rooted in differences in language, mindset, and methodologyâ€”I appreciate the importance of fostering curiosity, collaboration, and mutual understanding across disciplines.\nOutside of work, I enjoy running, cycling, and hiking in nature."

    "text": "During my bachelorâ€™s studies in business psychology, I primarily focused on the user perspective, utilizing methods from market research and consumer psychology to address specific content-related questions. I deepened this perspective through internships and research assistant positions at market research institutes such as Ipsos GmbH and Produkt+Markt GmbH.\nSimultaneously, I realized that I lacked knowledge in programming and modeling to develop models that are flexible enough to address both content-related questions and the particularity of data adequately. This realization led me to pursue a masterâ€™s degree in cognitive science, with specializations in artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology. During this time, I gained insights into formal modeling methods and their implementation in R and Python. In particular, I was greatly impressed by the flexibility offered by the Bayesian framework.\nThe desire to further deepen my knowledge in formal modeling, Bayesian statistics, and especially the computational implementation of methods led me to stay in academia as research associate first in psychological methods at Philipps-university of Marburg and then in computational statistics at TU Dortmund university. Information about my current contributions can be found on Publications & Talks page as well as on my project website.\n Download my CV."
