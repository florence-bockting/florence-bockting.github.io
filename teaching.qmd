## Teaching

**Seminar on multilevel models** (2023/24)

This seminar provides basic knowledge about linear and generalized linear multilevel models. Approaches from the frequentist and Bayesian paradigms are discussed. Course objectives include building a conceptual understanding of the various application areas, mathematical models, and the general analysis workflow of hierarchical modelling. Concerning the implementational aspects, we will use the programming language R (particularly the R-packages `lme4` and `brms`). <br>

**Introduction into Python** (2023/24)

This course provides an introduction in Python and introduces several tools to enable reproducible and reliable programming, including version control with `git`, collaborative programming via `GitHub`, testing with `pytest`, and documentation with `Sphinx`. By the end of the course, students should be capable of working on a project using Python and independently acquiring new Python knowledge.  <br>
