I am a research scientist specializing in method development and research software engineering. I divide my time between
two roles: at [Climate Resource](https://www.climate-resource.com/) I work on method development, climate science
research, and research software engineering.
Besides, I work at the [Chair of Computational Statistics at TU Dortmund](https://compstat.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/),
led by [Paul-Christian Bürkner](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/), where I am focusing on the development of
computational methods.

My current academic project involves developing and implementing a framework to translate expert knowledge into prior
distributions for parameters in Bayesian models (see [Publications & Talks](pubs.qmd) and
[project website](https://florence-bockting.github.io/elicito/)). This work combines concepts from statistics and
machine learning. At Climate Resource, I focus on developing methods to integrate satellite-derived data into the
production of greenhouse gas forcing inputs for Earth System Models. This work sits at the intersection of
environmental science, method development, and research software engineering.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of users, methodology, and implementation. Developing effective methods
requires a broad understanding across multiple disciplines, encompassing everything from identifying user needs to
statistical-mathematical modeling and computational implementation. I appreciate the [interdisciplinary nature](about.qmd)
of my work, as it continually challenges my current state of understanding, broadens my perspective, and allows me to
keep learning.

Beyond method development, I am particularly interested in knowledge transfer.
Having experienced firsthand the challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration, often due to differences
in language, acquired mindset, and methodology, I value the importance of fostering curiosity, collaboration, and mutual
understanding across fields.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, cycling, and hiking in nature.
