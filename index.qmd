I am a research associate specialized in method development at the [Chair of Computational Statistics at TU Dortmund](https://compstat.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/), led by [Paul-Christian Bürkner](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/). 

My current project focuses on developing and implementing a framework to translate expert knowledge into corresponding prior distributions for parameters in Bayesian models (see [Publications & Talks](pubs.qmd) and [project website](https://florence-bockting.github.io/prior_elicitation/)). This work integrates approaches from both statistics and machine learning.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of users, methodology, and implementation. Developing effective methods requires a broad understanding across multiple disciplines, encompassing everything from identifying user needs to statistical-mathematical modeling and computational implementation. I value how this work enables me to apply my [interdisciplinary experience](about.qmd) and continue to enhance my skills.

Beyond method development, I am deeply committed to knowledge transfer and supporting users in their analyses. Having experienced firsthand the challenges that arise from interdisciplinary communication—often rooted in differences in language, mindset, and methodology—I appreciate the importance of fostering curiosity, collaboration, and mutual understanding across disciplines.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, cycling, and hiking in nature.
